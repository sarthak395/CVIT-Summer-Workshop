# Document Imaging
# Skew correction
# Canny filters - Blurring + EdgeDetection
# Hough transforms - Detecting shapes
- Hough accumulator : Number of points through which a line passes
- Non-maximum suppression : Filtering out non-relevant lines
# Detecting dominant angle
- to get the orientation/skew angle , we have to subtract by 90
# Rotating
