# Document Imaging

## Task 1

# Skew correction
# Canny filters - Blurring + EdgeDetection
# Hough transforms - Detecting shapes
- Hough accumulator : Number of points through which a line passes
- Non-maximum suppression : Filtering out non-relevant lines
# Detecting dominant angle
- to get the orientation/skew angle , we have to subtract by 90
# Rotating
- Affine Transformation 

## Task 2

# Word Detection Contours
## Denoising the image
## Text dilation - to enlarge each letter and remove gaps inside words
## Word dilation - To seperate words
## Find Contours -  To get higher areas which symbolise words with a threshold on contour area
